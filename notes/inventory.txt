💻 1️⃣ Hardware Assets

These are physical items the company owns, uses internally, or deploys in client projects.
Examples:

Laptops, desktops, and monitors for employees

Network devices (routers, switches, servers)

Testing or development hardware (IoT boards, Raspberry Pis, sensors, etc.)

Printers, cables, UPS units, and accessories

➡️ In NovaERP terms:

Stored in Inventory table as itemName = "Dell Latitude Laptop" or itemName = "Cisco Router".

quantity tracks how many are available.

Linked to Supplier (e.g., “TechOne Distributors”).

lastUpdatedBy could be the IT admin managing asset records.

🧰 2️⃣ Consumables & Components

These are smaller parts or recurring-use materials often used in technical setups.
Examples:

Ethernet cables, power adapters, sensors, microcontrollers, external drives

Spare parts for repairs or client deployments

➡️ Used when the company implements or maintains IT infrastructure for clients.
Projects like “Smart Building Setup” or “IoT Monitoring Deployment” would use these.

💿 3️⃣ Software Licenses and Subscriptions

Although intangible, software licenses can also be tracked as part of the “inventory.”
Examples:

Microsoft 365 seats

Adobe Creative Cloud licenses

Antivirus subscriptions

SaaS credits or API keys

➡️ Each record can store:

itemName = "MS 365 Business License"

quantity = 20

price = 15 USD/month

supplierName = "Microsoft Partner Tunisia"

🧾 4️⃣ Client Deployments (Inventory linked to Projects)

When your IT company deploys hardware or software to a client as part of a project, that’s when inventory directly links to a project.

➡️ Example:

Project: “ERP Installation for ABC Corp.”

Inventory used:

2 × Dell PowerEdge Servers

10 × Software Licenses

1 × Router

In NovaERP:

The Inventory items are linked to the Project via the Many-to-Many relationship.

Helps calculate total project cost, asset movement, and replenishment needs.

🤝 5️⃣ Supplier Relationship

Even IT companies depend on suppliers for:

Buying hardware (laptops, routers)

Purchasing licenses (through resellers)

Maintenance agreements (for servers or software)

➡️ Supplier examples:

“HP Tunisia” → provides laptops

“Cisco North Africa” → provides network gear

“Microsoft Partner” → provides software licenses

This link helps automate purchase orders, stock updates, and vendor management.

🧭 In Short:
Purpose	Example	Why It’s in ERP
IT Equipment	Laptops, monitors, routers	Asset tracking & depreciation
Consumables	Cables, SSDs, sensors	Internal use or project deployment
Software Licenses	Office 365, antivirus	Renewal management
Client Materials	Hardware installed at client site	Project costing
Supplier Relations	HP, Cisco, Microsoft	Purchase & reordering

So even in a digital services company, the inventory module helps:

Track all company-owned or client-deployed assets

Monitor license renewals or hardware usage

Record supplier information and purchase activity

Maintain internal accountability (“who updated or moved this equipment?”)
